## üîß Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If you see `command not found: docubook`:

1. Check if Go is installed:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. Verify the binary was installed:
   ```bash
   ls -l $(go env GOPATH)/bin/docubook
   ```

3. If the file exists but still can't be executed, ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH.

### Permission Denied

If you encounter a permission error:
```bash
chmod +x $(go env GOPATH)/bin/docubook
```

### Update to Latest Version

To update to the latest version:

### Uninstalling DocuBook CLI

To uninstall DocuBook CLI globally, simply remove the binary from your system:

1. Remove the binary:
   ```bash
   rm $(go env GOPATH)/bin/docubook
   ```

2. (Optional) If you added the export line to your shell configuration file, you can remove it:
   - For Zsh (macOS):
     ```bash
     sed -i '' '/export PATH=\$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)\/bin/d' ~/.zshrc
     ```
   - For Bash:
     ```bash
     sed -i '' '/export PATH=\$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)\/bin/d' ~/.bash_profile
     ```

3. Verify the uninstallation:
   ```bash
   which docubook || echo "DocuBook CLI has been successfully uninstalled"
   ```

### Still Having Issues?

- Check your Go configuration:
  ```bash
  go env
  ```
- Look for any error messages during installation
- Verify you have write permissions to the Go bin directory
